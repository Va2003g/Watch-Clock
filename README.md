# Watch-Clock

This is my first project in my college. This is a simple alarm clock made with the help of CSS, HTML and Javascript. This is simply used to set an alarm.
This is multipage website having feedback page and about page. You can send me the feedback by filling the form. As I have functionality by which user send me the mail about their feedback.
The UI I know is quite simple but kindly have look into it..
